Logover is a C++ cross platform log file mechanism


Libraries and Build Tools
---------------------------------------
Logover does use other libraries to make the tasks involved more seemless.
Boost Libraries v1.42: http://www.boost.org/
Cmake v2.8: http://www.cmake.org/

Build
---------------------------------------
The proper way to build is to use an out of source build.  IE Logover/build using
cmake.  Boost libraries is being built statically into the library unless otherwise
specified.  If the boost libraries are not installed into the default locations
then they will manually have to be added to cmake during configuration.
